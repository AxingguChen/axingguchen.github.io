## Short bio

I obtained (2014) BSc in Computing Information Science from Guangdong University of Technology, China, and (2016) MSc in Computer Science and Engineering from Politecnico di Milano, Italy, respectively. After my masters, I joined UDBMS group in the Department of Computer Science at University of Helsinki as a doctoral student.

Currently, I am pursuing doctoral degree in the field of Multi-model Data and Big Data management.  I like problem modeling and programming. Also, I am enthusiastic for out-door activities, such as traveling, hiking, football, etc.
